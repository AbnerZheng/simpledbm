<p>Defines the interface for the Buffer Manager module.</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Buffer Manager is a critical component of any DBMS. Its primary job
is to cache disk pages in memory. Typically, a Buffer Manager has a fixed
size Buffer Pool, implemented as an array of in-memory disk pages.
The contents of the Buffer Pool change over time, as pages are read in, and
written out. One of the principle tasks of the Buffer Manager is to decide
which page should stay in memory, and which should not. The aim is to try to
keep the most frequently required pages in memory. The efficiency of the
Buffer Manager can be measured by its cache hit-rate, which is the ratio of pages found 
in the cache, to pages accessed by the system.
</p>
<p>In order to decide which pages to maintain in memory, the Buffer Manager
typically implements some form of Least Recently Used (LRU) algorithm. In the simplest
form, this is simply a linked list of all cached pages, the head of the list representing the
least recently used page, and the tail the most recently used. This is based on 
the assumption that if a page was accessed recently, then it is likely to be accessed
again soon. Since everytime a page is accessed, it is moved to the MRU end of the
list, therefore over time, the most frequently accessed pages tend to accumulate on the MRU side.
Of course, if a client reads a large number of temporary pages, then this scheme can
be upset. To avoid this, the Buffer Manager may support hints, so that a client can
provide more information to the Buffer Manager, which can then use this information
to improve the page replacement algorithm. An example of such a hint would be to
flag temporary pages. The Buffer Manager can then use this knowledge to decide that
instead of the page going to MRU end, it goes to the LRU end.</p>
<h2>Interactions with other modules</h2>
<p>The Buffer Manager interacts with the Log Manager
and the Page Manager modules. It needs the help of the
PageFactory in order to instantiate new pages, read pages from disk, and write out
dirty pages to disk. In order to support the Write Ahead Log protocol, the Buffer 
Manager must ensure that all logs related to the page in question are flushed prior
to the page being persisted to disk.</p>
<p>The Transaction Manager also interacts with the Buffer Manager. During checkpoints,
the Transaction Manager asks for a list of dirty pages. It uses information maintained
by the Buffer Manager to determine where recovery should start. After a system restart
the Transaction Manager informs the Buffer Manager about the recovery status of disk
pages.</p>
