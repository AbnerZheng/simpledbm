1.0.2-BETA:
 * dm: log.disableExplicitFlushRequests is now a property that can be set when creating a log instance.
 * dm: Property bufferpool.bufferWriterSleepInterval can now be set.
 * dm: Renamed Index to IndexContainer to match TupleContainer.
 * dm: Added a number of delegate methods in Server to simplify the API for clients.
 * dm: Server API simplified by removing accessor methods not required by most use cases.
 * dm: The openScan() method now accepts null key and null location parameters. If these are null,
       the scan starts from the first key in the tree. This similifies the interface for Server as
       there is no need to create minKey or null location.
 * dm: Allowed access to objectRegistry() from Server without a status check on the server, as there are
       legitimate use cases for this operation to occur prior to server start.

 * dm: Added CHANGES.txt.
 * dm: Renamed register() methods in ObjectRegistry to registerType() and registerSingleton().
 * dm: Removed getIndex(int) from IndexManager.
