<h1>Project Timescales</h1>
<p>I work on SimpleDBM in my spare time. I also have to do some amount
of research for each module. These two factors, combined with periods of
"inactivity" mean that I cannot provide a well-defined schedule for
completing the project. However, the design of SimpleDBM ensures that
that individual modules are usable immediately. Therefore, I believe
that the interim snapshots are useful as well, and I encourage you to
download SimpleDBM and experiment with the various modules.</p>
<p>I am keen for other developers to participate in this project and
will gladly provide assistance and answer queries. I think the project
is of particular interest to database technology students and
researchers.</p>
<h1>SimpleDBM Development Status</h1>
<p>The SimpleDBM development status is summarised by Module. <em>Available</em>
status means that this module has been implemented and its code is
available in the download area.</p>
